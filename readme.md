## Learning objectives

## The Mission
Twig is the Template language that symfony uses. We will no longer write PHP in our view-templates, but instead use the Twig syntax.

You can read more about the why and how on the [official documentation](https://twig.symfony.com/).



## Must-have features
Use the MVC Routing exercise you created previously. If yours was unstable, ask another student to use theirs. 

- in the base.html.twig file add a menu block in a <aside> tag (make it appear to the left with css). 
- Add a <footer>&copy; Becode</footer> in the base template file, this footer should appear on both pages!

I want you to add a menu block 

block + block extension
